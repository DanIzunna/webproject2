    <h1 class="text-center">Get to Know Us</h1>
    <p class="text-center">
        We started as an educational center in the city of Port Harcourt, aiming to provide affordable training to those in the garden city of Nigeria. 
        It's been over four years now, and we are still in the business of providing quality education for professionals. 
        We began with just one course, but we currently have multiple courses on our platform, with technically sound individuals signed up as tutors.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        We are on a mission to make tech education more effective by ensuring a direct connection between tutor and student.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        We have a vision to educate the continent of Africa into innovation. We want to see that everyone we train gets a good grasp of what they are taught, 
        and it becomes inevitable that they apply this knowledge to bring solutions to challenges facing the people of the continent.
